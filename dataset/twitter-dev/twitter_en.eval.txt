donald trump says “fifty percent” of americans are lazy freeloaders who “don’t have to do anything”

you may be able to unlock the battle location on the good guys side still. you could also try restarting the app.
ive restarted a few times already. problem with waiting for good guys is im at 183/300 kills and each 1 takes 10+s per kill
adds the word "racial" to trump's quote. deeply irresponsible. crosses the line.
he's right and along with some water boarding we're off to a good start!
you can thank / for the end credit sax solo in genghis--song is called outro:

you may be able to unlock the battle location on the good guys side still. you could also try restarting the app.
if it helps i think it may have been triggered by opening the game on a second device tied to the same gamecenter id.

i'll accept this as partial atonement for reaganomics and his son. george h.w. bush to vote for hillary

why did this make me legit upset
munchies really gmfu.. gained 5 pounds since school started 😭
anyone need a running partner hmu
it's merely an observation. why should i be ashamed? i've worked/been around angry people. not very enjoyable
because you sought out someone to be offended by, and then were offended that they were offended. grow up. be less racist.
build succeeded!!!
every successful build with xcode 8 is worth celebrating. 😀💀
when im not with you i lose my mind
currently listening to this song lol
there's literally no way to finesse us involvement here as not being disastrous

no rest for the wicked.
lol how've u been?!!

george h.w. bush is voting for hillary, so even though bush was a neocon, i respect him now. …
hillary is a neocon too, that's why hes supporting her, they are warmongers cut from the same cloth.

when ex-president george h.w. bush is voting for hillary you should know there is something wrong with trump:
you should know there's something wrong with clinton when all the warmongering neocons are on her side.
your pictures are 👌 missing san fran! :(
thank you i appreciate that!
this is a thing?
i've seen mad girls do this
at this point, don't waste your breath trying to convince trump voters that he's nuts. they don't care. work to get hrc supporters to polls.
it's so odd that they like the idea of getting someone with a mental illness in the office. lizard brains have ganged up.
please stay safe
thanks micky... i'll try
i can't wait for women around the world to really come together &amp; rewrite this really old outdated history from the collective mind

thats a good thing, we dont want warmongering neocons on our side, dems are the party of war now.
i'm really not joking rn though..
i got rid of it lmao where is ross
no, she isn't. she was lied into supporting the iraq war.
thats why the bushs are with her, because she will continue their war agenda
me explaining my late-night twitter to friends: "see, this time -- from 1am to 3am -- this is my 'me' time."

does anyone know how much a 24 hr fitness membership is at costco?! 🤔
299 for 2 years regular and 499 for super sport i think
george h.w bush is voting for hillary clinton. lol. if that is not a burn i don't know what is.
it's a burn for hillary, shes the war candidate now. all the warmongers are on her side.
do you perhaps have the deets on that bat artist for your bat?
she doesn't have a twitter (at least i don't think so). i messaged her on facebook just fine, though.
thank you guys for sharing your videos to us 😘
of course love
can't blame him. and this is the guy who said "we need more of the waltons and less the simpsons."
he's just mad cause he lost the neighbor war to homer in that one episode
me a racist? that's laughable meet my god son. he is my super hero your assumptions are way off base
so that means it's ok to get into a native woman's mentions, judging whether she should be offended by co-optation?
who else does that ? lie in bed wide awake and calculates how many hours of sleep you can get if you fall asleep at that exact moment?
me every single day. 😬
who on earth gave you a cd full of data
the hospital gave me mri results burned to disk. i had to choose between that and film.

2 and some odd hours left about to start climbing some ladders
to phil boyle
i feel bad for all these industry series since they immediately get compared to shirobako, and it's hard to live up to that.
both new game and shirobako are based from industry insiders pov, but i think latter had better life experience.
i start from there
aug 2016 saa + allies: 898 isis: 179 opposition: 148 sdf: 30 int'l coalition: 7
2016 giants. now we know their bullpen is the issue here.
offensive luck has also diminished. luck with risp was great early on. ability to bail out a bad start is also just coincidence
nothing ever counts on a tuesday
hows that love ???
someone come over and make sure i stop being a dud and write my summary.
stop being a dud and write your summary

fu and your racist card 😘😜😇🖕💩
what is my "racist card," exactly?
offensive luck has also diminished. luck with risp was great early on. ability to bail out a bad start is also just coincidence
if their first and second halves both had them playing .527 ball, we wouldn't be surprised. just the way it's been clustered
well, as long as you got your coffee fix! so what brings you to mexico? there on vacation?
i was djing at a rave!had lots of fun!
clearly different priorities here lol
i was laughing so hard !!!! i thoughthe really died ...
that def reminds me of the 2014 a's. it's like they were running in mud
except the 2014 a's were legitimately amazing in the first half.
children in iraq &amp; syria need for love &amp; peace ugly war destroy our souls before our bodies i wish the wars end war so ugly
indeed sara. we should all strive for peace. war is horrible and it's the people who suffer.
rt five questions every competent recruiter can answer
i agree with 2-5, makes the chat mercenary and as a former recruiter, worse hires were based on money 1st
except the 2014 a's were legitimately amazing in the first half.
i think it was something like 55 of their first 61 games, they either led, tied or at least had the tying run on deck in the 9th
you must take a bite, there is no choice …
seeing bush supporting hillary should tell you something. get on the trump train bro.
that feel when you accidentally turned off the power to your newly-stocked fridge for 10 hours. 😬
so that’s what that switch does
again, i hate this fucking election. "all caps hashtag dumb meaningless gibberish trummmmmmmmmmp!" ok bro.
this guy tweeted this to everyone who mentioned the word twitter, because that's what we do now i guess
i'm ready for the offseason.... i've never felt this way before 😭 lol

throwback hahahahahahaha
&amp; i'm sure trump's praise for putin will draw all the anti-war vote to his camp. stop hallucinating.
why do you want war with russia? we spent 50 years trying to avoid that.

it's a parody account set up by a trumpeter
giants have 30 blown saves. i'm kind of in awe of just how godawful that is. dubious distinction

no. you are confusing middle eastern countries.

poverty is a billion dollar industry from social workers to jails and schools etc we are the lab rats for it
third world muslim men (skittles) are not civilized enough 2 be trusted around any women!

did we? this is serendipity 😊 when was this?
when you compare humans to skittles, outrage ensues (of course!)

yeah, i don't get the pearl-clutching on this. mugshot in the post probably has the same risks, bias is baked in regardless.
please - show your stats that pack up the syrian refugee threat.
it only takes one einstein!
hillary is so concerned about lumping muslims in with ahmad khan rahami, but she had no problem lumping americans into a deplorable basket.
excellent pt! it's like the kids' movie,"zootopia";super pc re: 2 characters,but they stereotype the shit out of everyone else

it's a perfect analogy. was there outrage by your news org when hillary called millions deplorable? answer is no
she was telling the truth. the deplorables are all over social media with their blind hate.
civilians are forced to suffer the consequences.
and couldn't come at a worse time for civilians.
but maybe the consumers don't know this! (most clueless)

i am certain that is already looking into this. sadly media is dead silent.
send us your confirmation with this link and we'll check it out.
team at the gate got it squared away. thanks!! 👏
and you know what - even if he had done something wrong - no one deserves to be executed in the street
also i bet the racist lunatic cops that perpetrated this consider themselves "pro-life"
a terrorist set off a bomb and shot 4 cops but was brought in alive, but cops wanna kill unarmed black men
.a who woould still be at large were it not for the who disarmed 2nd bomb
that time you don't have your headphones and some woman is blasting tunes/cellphone ringers on an otherwise quiet morning commute. 😡

she thinks his dad should be the one to do it. but here's my problem with that. his dad is a homicide detective &amp; a real jackass.

great candidate takes the lead. but right wing pacs pouring money into race. they don't want teachout to win.

i meant your pig ass daddy, she'll be voting for the real president
my notifications worked for you! *hugs* i'm well! how are you?

george soros is truly an insane man.
perhaps dncmedia edited the full statement? $500 million for refugees (terrorist training).

apparently mangos been cheating on her and has been abusive.

first question was a comment on fusion power - wasn't expecting that - would be so proud.

the other was stopping the banning of online sales. i think bo is a tacit advocate. pence is openly hostile.

you keep conflating trump &amp; his supporters. we support him 2b president. you lump us as 1 entity. cowardly acts, sure, but labels?
what in trump's past before last june was indicative to u that he was pro-life? that he was devoutly religious?
it's been 55 days since trump held a presser. clinton has taken ?'s 6 times in 2 weeks. (trump took ?'s from limited group 15 days ago.)
he won't take anymore questions from the press. he will only take ?? from interviewers he approves now.

i just deleted all my other social media apps. so, i guess you can say things are getting pretty serious between twitter and i.
stay faithful, but tumblr is tempting...
trump has moved on from "i know you are but what am i" to "you're copying me."
to be fair, his newest campaign management has been trying to explain "stop hitting yourself stop hitting yourself" to him for weeks
best show? are you watching the leftovers, rectify, or fargo?
let me rephrase, my favorite show.
you keep conflating trump &amp; his supporters. we support him 2b president. you lump us as 1 entity. cowardly acts, sure, but labels?

can't find it anywhere sold out over here 😩
can you read? it was to defend lawsuits against his for-profit business. idiot.
a flag fine was settled by trump giving money to a charity, paid by trump's charity. he should go to jail for this!

no, implying trump supporters lesser (deplorable?) as you assume they/we won't grasp words like demagogic. .
let's attend a trump rally and see how many do.
columnists are court jesters or jokers of the newsroom. they are not held to same standards. hence they can lie.
to the credit, their executives, esp. quickly corrected the inaccurate facts
and please tell me how assad's methods differ from the methods of the rebels? they are both using weapons to
barrel bombs. incendiary attacks. gas. "double tap" bombings. mosques, schools, food/water sources.
i guess my next question is: why did it take so long to get re-routed?
i was on the last bos flight sun night. not sure why it wasn't rerouted for the lgb-bosam flight, but it was sent last night
oh man i had a thud buster in my amazon cart for a few minutes before i was like "what am i doing?"
the answer is "putting a big steal me sign on my bike seat"

at this point i think a conversation outside of twitter is best.
you are pretty❤️
thank you 💜💜
how ironic, has nearly obliterated the middle class in america!
no, that would be in the republican red states. obama inherited worst recession since 1929 from bush. has added 9m jobs.
actually, i bet jennifer aniston is a compassionate person who would not revel in someone else's misery.
it's been how long? she's married and has moved on. a bit insulting to her to think she actually cares.
oops except not really
hey, mind if post this tweet on for an article on this hashtag? thanks!

this blows... my mind 😉
lmao well played sir well played indeed
go off grid to seek next level.
hop off the porch. real life it.
what is blm actively doing to fix the enormous amount of lives taken by black on black violence, welfare, etc?
blm is in the community calling for changes along those lines. i have heard the speeches &amp; seen the grass roots
obama: “we must reject... racism, or a belief in ethnic superiority” and embrace tolerance
- the last 8 yrs you !@! obama have done everything you can to destroy america. wake up america. get his sorry ass out of our house now
ethan never hesitates to tell me he will soon be taller than me.
sam tells me the same. and i know it will be soon.
💥💥💥 unbelievable this is a must watch 17 second video that will convince you not to support 💀👿💀👿💀
real muslim people who make up 99% are peaceful, it's radicals who have twisted the faith who are terrorist
lol don jr is ruining his political career by opening his mouth
and inserting skittles
the champion you got dis.
but yea def gonna grind it out for sure.
my hot take is that jill schoelen is the ex that brad cares about the most.
and, also, can angie finally do salt 2 now?
unfortuantely, we're unable to communicate gate/pilot via twitter. *ls
horrible customer service at the gate 41 in jfk. the plane was barely off the gate and we called delta and returned to get us
i'm non-religious. it's wrong by all religions but we can prevent the above from happening.
no it's a dumb white nationalist argument.
awwww congrats!!!
thank you!! 😘
amazing work, and utterly infuriating that you're the only one digging up with this stuff. where's cnn? nyt?

u can call him whatever u want but muslim privilege is far from a proper term. what special rights do we all get🤔
still don't change the fact terrorist be captured alive and things like oklahoma be happening
unfortuantely, we're unable to communicate gate/pilot via twitter. *ls
we called delta and we are sky priority. the rep said he would let the gate know and didn't
i'm actually about to have $2 in checking myself not realizing my car pmt was due before my paycheck came lol so 🤘
i'm more motivated at work when i have literally no safety net to rely on
this makes it ok?
absolutely not. any death is tragic. merely suggesting that focusing on the entire issue will save more lives
their tears and sorrow, their sadness, their heartbreak, their hopelessness, all their suffering will fill my soul with joy &amp; happiness.
their sorrow will taste as good as the lips of the one you love. their despair will make me as happy as i get during christmas time.
follow back honey, please❤
sorry i didnt see love my notifs are flooded haha

hillary clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest. sleep well hillary - see you at the debate!
could you be a bigger dick?
that's a fact
matter of fact jose when are you gonna bring your friends down here 🤔
what makes me most annoyed is this guy is usually super nice and polite, and like now i wonder if he's secretly been condescending all along
this is the worst!
but you can't just take them away from the speech! he's just said he believes american model is the best and winning one
the speech has emphasized globalism so far; not american values. that's always been the obama agenda.
unfortuantely, we're unable to communicate gate/pilot via twitter. *ls
we made the original flight time but our flight left early causing us to miss it, as a frequent flier an silver i am very unhappy

such a cool update, ! and smart too. i'm guessing the iphone 7 has something to do with this? 🤔
it's an old feature that didnt work b4. but this looks cool asf. weird i took 2 yesterday &amp; didn't c the feature.
hillary blamed brutally beaten 12 year old victim for being raped, laughing about it. don't believe me? this is
hilary pilloried a 12 yr old raped girl but do cnn, msnbc, abc, ny times, wash post, huff post care? no.
good luck! sorry to miss it.

the time for jennifer aniston tweets is over. the time for juliette lewis tweets has begun
you're not actually a gen x-er joe despite your twitter presence
brad pitt is going to date em rata. mark my wordsssss. i am always correct.
em rata is the new and improved angelina jolie. a sex symbol, a faux feminist, a lover of an op-ed, charitable, minimal talent.
hate when professors so more topics than what we need to know on tests
making me waste paper and shit
i don't give a damn what sexist pricks think.
on that, we can agree! 😂
i found it was split enough for me, actual split keyboards moved around too much for me :(

millions? are you being serious? do you think a vote for stein or anyone else will further your agenda?
yes adding up those killed in iraq, syria, libya, honduras &amp; yemen should add to millions. even at 110s of 1000s, its awful

if you commit acts of terrorism and make it alive that's privilege
blm only pops up when someone is murderd by cops. then it goes silent while black lives are taken by each other.

nice!! what shows did you go to? and i have one seated ticket row 16, one golden circle ticket and one ticket for pit!
i went to see him at philly newark and new york at msg and cool
so the way i see it, there are 2 interpretations of this story. one is bp's (i.e. that his fans frequently fart around him)
the other (and i think more likely) interpretation: brad pitt is a liar/serial farter who regularly blames his farts on his fans
we are all going to die it's just the question of how
you put that pretty blunt
lmao some ppl are quoting this and saying the ppl that are offended are right.....yikes
ok i hate them bc this was everything to me

he explicitly said the american model was not necessarily the one others should follow. and yes, i have read and understand it.

. past help like questioning the birthplace of the first black president? calling all mexicans rapists? try reading a newspaper

for everyone outraged about anthem protests, do you have the same outrage over terence cutcher? that's the real issue. we need to fix it.
it's about time, place and manner of the protests. people who have reverence for the flag also condemn illegal acts of cops.
and if we learned anything from 2008, it's that americans care a lot ab their homes.
"there was no question in my mind that it was a bullying deal" sounds like 2008 to me.
if dc can't get a win at at&amp;t over the raggedy bears, who played mon night probably need to tear $1.2b gem down &amp; try again
also, i just read that cutler is likely to miss several weeks with thumb injury.
america has never made progress by thinking one person alone can fix our problems.
you actually have no sense of direction when it comes to being president. you are too worried about getting muslims here

could we go down to 8% book outfits and 1% adorable pictures of pets and animals?
that would be a great idea.
islam is perfect ❤️
no it's not. it produces political hate between the practicing sects of islam and creates jihadist. plus it's fiction
they weren't out of line with a lot of prominent black scholars e.g. dubois' "talented tenth". different era
prominence doesn't equate to being right on an issue
thank u for this thread
i haven't been this happy in months!
trust—built into the heart of most economic activity—is being eroded by politicians
absolutely and abused by large market players.

ok, freak-who-won't-sleep-anywhere-but-trump tower.

less than a week before the first presidential debate, a viable path to victory has emerged for donald trump.
warning! at best four years of trump will be four long wasted years of no progress.
if you work hard, you should be able to find a good job that pays well and lets you do what you love and make your mark on the world.
and who are you kidding. the jobs have been taken with muslims and mexicans winning all the way
why, what's happening at midnight, is hammond having his hair done and it's going up in price to pay for it?

the mother of this child was lied to by team hillary; had no idea about the pneumonia.
this is a child actor. was also photographed with the pope. can still catch bacterial pneumonia tho!
your story is sadly all too common in this country. but is it fair to claim to be objectively superior given your history?

hey hyd ii got beats
no. you aren't. you're a naive purist who doesn't grasp that democracy works by compromise. 98% don't support you &amp; never will.
she's neither of those things. the only purists are you warmonger hillary supporters expecting everyone to vote lie you.
did u buy tickets already
u know i did for december 😏😏
can't find pic but it was local here in the city. residence inn near columbus circle with a kitchen
a kitchen is great for traveling families!
if they are trying to make the switch to fios, follow and dm us so we can look at options. ^dfm
before anyone switches to they should know that manhattan customers have been without service for 4 days.
it astounds me that some people genuinely believe that literally every single muslim is a terrorist...i have no words for their ignorance
and then they're usually the ones who spew "not all ___" in any other given situation
because they think that all black men in these types of cases are criminals. 😑
it would be great if the media could be more responsible when reporting these stories. he was a stranded motorist,and that's all.
agreed, but the malfeasance doesn't stop at their level
ive been told the quotas and they're unreasonable and a poor model. i agree on that.

if they are trying to make the switch to fios, follow and dm us so we can look at options. ^dfm
and they’re still lying, hiding and stonewalling.
what you are is a do nothing but lip service candidate
the only lip service is yours. stein went to help give exposure to the lakota while warmonger hillary said and did nothing.
nobody cares or nobody hears about it?
is there a difference in today's world? lol sheeple right?
city slickers my man, that was hilarious out loud laughing funny. "if hate were people, i'd be china" one good line
ha. that is a good line.
they need to thank allah for that, so, who has to work? slaves, some part can be done by women, who's close to that, why?
because all men of all religions decided to put women on the point of fallen. jewish people don't, in their case that's all in one

i can cite many occasions joe hot totally rejected. he couldn't even get a personal parking space.
please, adam, if jay paterno were the kid in the showers in 2001, you think he believes he dad did enough?

why would joe even think mike knew who the kid was? he left that to those he was supposed to leave it to.
thanks adam. good luck with the site. keep people reading. it's a valuable thing.
this idea had good intentions but it's all a shark has to do is put up 50 h2hs and unreg all experienced matchups
solution to this would be to only let inexperienced people unreg ?
here's an idea-how about we stop destroying countries and in turn we stop creating refugees
that would be too easy. obama likes to create conflict and then pretend he had nothing to do with it.
trump's misdeeds are amateur hour compared to the clinton crime syndicate. she must be stopped.
palm beach waived fine if trump’s club made $100,000 donation to a specific charity for veterans. his foundation did. illegal.

everyone tries to front like they're here for "diversity" but when it comes down to talking about real issues all these yt kids are silent
it's hilarious because none of them will look me in the eye anymore since i've consistently called them out on their bs 💁🏽
thanks for the added background on the piece. and mike, thanks for writing it.
welcome todd. appreciate the support.
i feel like a lot of people would turn libertarian if they just grokked the fact that the government uses dogs to control them.
the gov doesn't need dogs to control most voters are sheep &amp; follow whoever mainstream media supports

colin powell says no one likes your candidate
trump is a loudmouth, racist demagogue whose only interest is what it's always been:
my last newsletter was read an extra 24 more times and i just want to say thank you to everyone who supports me, i love you

you say you don't believe i was trying you yet you send "precautionary statements". i can't believe this. but it's cool.

trump again says the terrorist attacks in ny &amp; nj “made possible by our extremely open immigration system” that fails to screen immigrants.
is it that hard to see that donald trump is desperately fanning flames of hysteria to advance his campaign?
first off nobody rioted. people voiced their opinions, and second plenty of people are talking now about the shooting.
wouldn't burning kaepernick's jersey be considered an act of rioting?
you are a star, my friend!!! you deserve all the great things in your life
thanks! can't wait!
elizabeth warren is needed on that committee forever, the end.
this is how it is done. is fearless and a rock star. i love listening to her.

that's a beautiful word salad that means...nothing.

nyt chased after the wrong foundation, but are they going to make this right?

in terrorism cases w/ that's not the case. no jury, no trial

whats the problem my guy?
this is a total bummer. also why am i getting this news from techinsider?
they don't have enough ipos pr unicorns who haven't does yet. so celeb gossip is what's left for pv
always ask: do we really need a meeting for this? do we really need a slide deck for this? do i understand this enough to articulate simply?
in my experience, a good half of meetings booked are unproductive or unnecessary. asking these questions helps save precious time!
y'all got players saying they wish they went to a better school. let kaaya vibe.

looking at the young trump supporters behind him full of hate at his rally in nc is the closes images we've seen since civil rights era

happy birthday to my best friend 💞👯 i love you so much, idk what i'd do without u ☹️💓
i love you bff 💕 thank you ❤️
no, i didn't miss that part. but i also never called you out or called you defensive or anything. i simply explained myself,
and what exactly am i trying to do here? nobody called you out. i was not attacking you and yet, this became combative.
again, if it's received wisdom that sid was blabbing around town over this, where are the other people the talked to?
worth noting that "why did we never hear of this" goes both to his credibility, &amp; inability of clinton to ever respond.
we don't blame you! so how's the move going so far? already packed up?
nah, just a bunch of suitcases. ☺️

my tuesday morning class is probably my favorite class this semester, except that group discussions scare the hell out of me.
mainly because people have very strong opinions, and while i agree with them, i also feel like people are kind of judgmental.

we've had patrons complain about $5 covers on nights that we've had two out-of-town bands playing! smh.

i hate high grant but i had the biggest crush on martine mccutheon when i was a kid. she had a song i was obsessed with.
who was martine?
ucla fan said he was soft in high school so he tweeted a pic of his hs championship ring.
lol what's the problem.
looks like it is photo from last year.. did doc send u new photos?
this photo and one of him together is the only photos he's got. so it might be from last year. i just emailed him to clarify.
today as a gift from , they better do well and get a w considering it's my special day! 😃🙏🙏🎁⚾
happy birthday! they owe you a win!

definitely! i must have referenced it dozens of times. 💯
i'm honestly a bit confused why no one has brought me or my books any cake. perhaps i will take this matter into my own hands.
there is no cake but what we make.

dowrey on connor mcgover: "he has a bright future. not many guys can be a true freshman and step on the field. talented guy. smart guy."

mainly because people have very strong opinions, and while i agree with them, i also feel like people are kind of judgmental.
so basically, i feel like if i have trouble wording my opinion the right way or forget an important point, people are judging me hard.
i know you guys want to "get to know me" offline, but i don't do that, not to be rude..that's not in my job description. talk to me online!
love ya and brick.
another unarmed black man has been killed by police - this victim even had his hands up.

this has to be the greatest twist in the history of twitter:
so donald jr. stole a refugee's image to make a hateful, un-american claim casting suspicion on all refugees.
do people notice hillary is copying my airplane rallies - she puts the plane behind her like i have been doing from the beginning.
she is a monkey see monkey do. but....trump force one is very very classy inside loved it.
1.4 / 1.5 are both eol'ed - so this change wouldn't be back ported.
we'll likely backport to 1.4 for bootstrapping reasons. but not 1.5
september has been nothing short of a torch in the eastern half of the us. many place 4+°f above normal, some place…

when my daughter goes to college i am going to be a big brother, instead of talking the talk i will be walking the walk.
trump says he'll sever all connections to the trump organization. so will he never see his kids, who run it, again?
trump's campaign is a conflict of interest. should have separated family from organization before running.

ahahhaha! lahat tayo gus2 first!
it makes perfect sense guy?¿
in what fantasy world ? pokémon ?
mind boggling that trump uses his charity, funded by others, to pay his own bills. what american, even his supporters, is ok with that?
they don't care! sad.
my gripe about google papers is that they are usually about what a system looked like 5 to 10yrs ago
that is among my top 3 gripes, yes
ridge &amp; brooke needs to stop with the looks 😂😂😂 i cant lmao
fake and forced.
lol this is me. we could've had it all. :) those two are so great together and it shows. lol
with a minor on the set this year that swear jar will get a lot of action, no doubt.
snap snap!! ahah but you got this girl 👍🏻❤️
thank you❤️❤️❤️❤️
and how is that his fault ? you think he's protesting injustice to help his jersey sales go up?🤔
i wasn't saying it in a bad way, i'm saying he protested his way gained support, everyone doesn't agree but it's his right
tabloid rumors become true because the least interesting bad thing usually happens eventually!!
spent an hour wrangling old tabloid covers then saw that beat me to it, so plz look at all those on jezebel its a wild ride
so i guess all those pundits saying how great kids are during the trump convention aren't the best…
whole trump family should be investigated under rico statutes.

something confusing about urdu poetry is the obsession with wine &amp; erotic seduction. that said, i've never heard a ghazal to prosciutto.
isn't that the same as requiring a vagina (or willing to get one) to seriously discuss female reproductive rights?

the ppl that disagreed burnt his shit, but obviously more ppl agreed because his sales went up. i don't think it was a stunt
the meltdown with &amp; is back on tuesday nights at midnight starting 9/27 (ok fine it's technically 9/28)!
don't be a nerd!
a man that came in when you and others insulted him, call him muslim, tell him to go back to kenya and more
obama will go down in history as one of the best presidents ever
another unarmed black man was shot in a police incident. this should be intolerable. we have so much work to do. -h
our police forces need urgent reprogramming on the use of deadly force. they are acting on fear...
after this "bad muslim" was caught today i thought the "good muslims" would be happy....nope crickets again🤔
if obama wasn't letting all the muslim brothers out of guantanamo, shoot to wound should be leo code ¿¿¿

i definitely agree with brad. pb and j is racist
i didnt even express an opinion.
no. i want to get to the truth &amp; not just make assumptions about what happened.
1. you don't believe kid in 76. 2. you don't believe joe knew of 98 investigation. 3. joe never knew till 01.
i don't think she ever looks good. she's not healthy it's obvious. i don't wish her harm. but "no hillary for president "

a prerequisite to any serious discussion of immigration is that all participants be able to entertain denying themselves entry as immigrants

that led me to a blog called shakesville, which was my first exposure to intersectional feminism. race, religion, disability, class, &amp; more.
i read a post there one day, criticizing the "but some of my best friends are black" thing that some people do when they say racist stuff.
approved for the apartment. internet is 100 mbps up/dn. that's really all i needed.
internet bandwidth compensates for just about anything.

a better way to increase the bottom line than increasing the top line - stop making time wasting costly mistakes. 🤔
yeah, that framing is just weird. also its thing these days where the rich make these grand public pledges about their money
they aren't actually pledging to give wealth away, they are just announcing they have money, and may spend it. like zuckerberg

you "support hillary"? what sort of nigerians has the clinton foundation done business with? who is likely to influence her nigeria policy?
the foundation is a charity- not a business. thus, no "business" for nigerians to be had w/ foundation.

56% of americans think trump either was never a birther or is secretly still one. just 19% say real change of heart
i'm curious what percentage think he's an asshole and/or always has been one.
he is truly "the best" sociopathic personality. what's really sad is that people only seem to love trump for his money or opportunistically.
when donald trump is on his deathbed at 106, his heirs will be fighting over how to get his money like evil spoiled children. mark my words.

i also noticed that for some reason tech billionaires seem to raise fairly normal kids compared to other billionaires. like jobs &amp; ballmer.
my plea is temporary insanity induced by lack of carbs

apparently ycombinator still has two weeks left to apply, has a one person team ever successfully applied?
yes, i believe drew from dropbox did, and i think i've heard of others
i also noticed that for some reason tech billionaires seem to raise fairly normal kids compared to other billionaires. like jobs &amp; ballmer.
as overbearing and bullying as steve jobs &amp; steve ballmer were known to be in their ceo roles, they seem to have raised normal families.

i agree but you just said "not enough support". the support is an economic one imo.
i think you're being optimistic about forward-lookingness vs entrenchment of fossil fuel systems.
i should just do it, i just hate healing piercings &amp; nipples apparently take like a year to fully heal.

that's great. since you have such good taste, we have to ask -- have you ever ate at our spot?
not yet but i will try to visit your store when i'm la next time! thanks for the recommendation:)
exactly. i can't go back. i don't know what to do with something smaller.

distribs keep chasing kids, but older people actually go to the movies when those movies court them.
old people still go to the movies and can't use the internet. makes sense.
i dont even know this kid nnn and we had such a validating moment where i knew i wasnt the only one who could sense it was a rip off
this made me strangely happy i enjoy this story

when will i find someone to make gymkata 2 with me?
i think that if d-rose's defense team can establish that she's a hooker, they'll win.

here's pic of closed window 'reached into' yes...that's his blood. …

im watching it right now and im so excite !!
it wld b interesting to explore this further, my initial view is that ppl choosing reconciles heterogeneity though

i'd like to make a parody video called 10 things wrong with youtube drama, but how do i exaggerate something that's already so ridiculous?
put that theater degree to use, josh.

that's my go to excuse when i just don't show up for work. damn outlook!
in contrast to turner's bac which was 2x the legal limit for driving. unsurprising.
legal limit for driving is entirely irrelevant since no one was operating a motor vehicle.
my tl is send mixed sports msgs today. ok ppl which is worse, the death of on-base skills or nfl offensive line play this season?
death of on-base is worst. it means that players are checking out mentally, body follows brain in baseball. can't fake it.
no they are taught that by their parents trust me as a person who moved into a hood as a child and they watched me in stores
parents loved me. i was the first minority they ever met, they put me on to cash money and wouldn't even go to a show.
whenever someone tries to flirt with me i just pull up my phone and
omg badra im dying haha. the same thing happened to me when i had u as my wallpaper&lt;3

it's just non-sensical that a company that recently invested millions wld throw it away.
they're being hammered by discriminatory policies
looks like the lines are about to cross.
it's getting worst
yeah but hdr is arguably a bigger benefit than resolution. if reg ps4 can do it why get a pro?
it's a rhetorical question, but you see my point?
which, if you have a ps4 who is to say the necessary signaling couldnt be emulated.
emulating that seems like a bit of work, maybe , but again if so sony should clarify
they did respond; it's pretty good but not lawsuit good. see this article:
article won't come up, but if it's the "skittles aren't people" response, i loved it...
no blame, and we're sorry you were stranded. service ends when it ends, even after levi's events ^ck

that does not establish that she "was unconscious" at the time of penetration.

i am aware of her record. and trump's. he rips off people with fraud. treats people like serfs. his foundation is crooked. a con.

the 3:07pm train from penn due ronkonkoma at 4:25pm is 10 minutes late due to congestion caused by a non-passenger train near deer park.

those were powerful closing statements imo. i think state will prevail.

i've seen misspelled words in them, too.
that's really bad.
dammit. but yes, that was it, and saying they're not responding further so it is not misinterpreted as marketing.
that's class. you also read about the photographer? i'm so sick of this horrible family (trumps, obv).

having a bac of .24% certainly does not absolve a drunk person of personal responsibility.
today i was told if i don't want antisemitic replies i should take "jewish" out of my bio. remind me not to dress too sexy around that guy.

having a bac of .24% certainly does not absolve a drunk person of personal responsibility.
more so, bac is irrelevant unless operating a motor vehicle, so it's moot.

inspector gen stated this created a significant financial risk. she made files disappear.

3) the first draft of dodd frank would certainly have been tougher. but it still would have needed to attract a republican vote.
4) i do think a warren-ified admin would have done more on housing and clawing back banker bonuses.

trump’s calls to torture and mistreat prisoners go against the very values we are fighting to defend. we’re better than this.
yes, we are, trump isn't.

here are the trump boys at their finest. they are definitely a product of genetics…
only a retard would compare $6 billion in missing funds to a $20 lunch.
it's called an analogy so that even someone w/ a 4th grade reading level could understand.
street harassment is a real thing.

dan that's the saddest thing i've ever heard but i'll allow it
only a retard would compare $6 billion in missing funds to a $20 lunch.
obviously this was giving you too much credit.
sorry, it seems like you didn't want to be open minded on our discussions. sorry 🙏
how am i not open minded? i'm judging on hrc policies..so you support fracking..gmos and war? not me.

this is tragic

hard to put into words the extent to which this didn't happen
only thing that makes me believe is that the trump supporter went right for the "well that just proved my point ad hominem blah"

trump speaks of an immigration system that reflects "american values." here's my take on that:
why not ask hillary? her answers are always changing to reflect current polling!

i’m probably over-speculating this whole thing.

it's gimmicky with team europe &amp; team na, but i love those squads and they bring a different dynamic from other international tournaments.
i think team na is gimmicky but team euro is a great idea. allows players whos country isnt big enough to field a team participate
oh no! dm us your order # and the location you visited. we'll look into this for you!
i never got a receipt with my order so i don't know the order number. it was at the tribeca location in nyc.

i understand your stance. let's go back to 1999 when sandusky retired. he didn't retire on his own free will.
no, you're right. fact that joepa got rid of him but still gave him a key so he could take kids to football building is damning.
but i guess holding the players inside as a way to fabricate patriotism is okay, but standing up (i guess kneeling) for your beliefs isnt? k

i remember a sikh man was killed a couple of miles from where i was celebrating my 25th birthday in 4 days after 9/11 in arizona.
he was killed because he was wearing a turban. so disgusting. it's haunted me.
i know all crime shows now i do like pretty little liars.
i loved cold case too
i woke up this morning at like 6:30 and when i got up to go to the bathroom my dad was in his room listening to adele not moving at all
ur dreams are coming true ❤️
really, robert?
the uk has had a queen for over 60 yrs, 2 pms and here in the usa we r debating can clinton wear pants and bake if she's potus
all of this talk of terrorism should include victims like right? waiting on statements from candidates 🤔
are we still waiting on those statements?
wes () is sharing so much great advice.
thank you, chuck.
so apparently i'm the right shape to be a spandex pumpkin =d but is a pumpkin orange only? full hood or kneck down only?
actually, the stem on top is brown, not green.
if you are black &amp; you support hillary bringing in migrants costing $66k a person while blacks suffer, y r a special stupid

hmmm ok.. the bible is fiction. have a good day pretending heaven exists :)
to be fair, a lot of movies i saw as a kid were scary. i don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.
a lot of the movies that i remember as "scary" from when i were young were pg-13 like independence day, not stuff "for kids"
trump’s calls to torture and mistreat prisoners go against the very values we are fighting to defend. we’re better than this.

yes it does guess why they are sentimental to me
a vague, pretentious statement that holds no weight. blacks in all regions of the world produce shitty communities.
wonder why you loud racist people never put a photo of yourselves up on twitter. why?
nobody said anything when nw high school would scream "and the home of the jags" or how orioles fans scream "o" during the anthem.
the anthem is supposed to be a moment of silence right? but i guess doing what you want in your favor is okay. doesnt offend you there
my roommate and my homie were on the way to a meeting with a bigger girl. she was out of breath and my roomie told her "don't push yourself
we can take a break whenever you want" that is probably the meanest nice thing i've ever heard lol
does it get any more fake or pandering than this???
______hon you douchin' with the hot sauce again?
most likely not. but paterno had to live with the fact that he didn't do more. that alone is torture and can break any person
this is true. and going to your grave with that is a rough one. it's a good point and reason not to further vilify him.

the title of this session is "media in transition" &amp; my summary is that doesn't like any media post-
so, in conclusion, media is done...rip media, it's been real 😢
... changed as in they changed the definition the fbi uses. it still almost exclusively applies to female vics-
"still almost exclusively applies to female vics"&lt;--why not also males if 'digital penetration' is included?

it has been a standard in law for an incredibly long time, yes. it does not need to _continue_ being standard.
but then allegations of 'rape' would skyrocket if now including non-rape in the category of 'rape'.
it sounds such hyperbole, even though it isn’t, that millennials are not taking it seriously. direct experience!
if true, then millennials may not be racist idiots who actively vote for a racist idiot, but they're no less ignorant.

it has been a standard in law for an incredibly long time, yes. it does not need to _continue_ being standard.
so that fact that the fbi changed their def. of 'rape' for data-collecting, isn't too relevant, is it?

u just can't prove he exists so u are scared to even talk on the subject. i've seen u avoid questions from every atheist
but then allegations of 'rape' would skyrocket if now including non-rape in the category of 'rape'.
if anyone could legally accuse someone of 'rape', over non-rape actions, that would really screw system up.
listened to the podcast today. i have to say, to this day i still get creeped out by the troll from ernest scared stupid 😂😂

isis doesn't invade countries the way hitler did. they invade through the internet and brainwash mostly

the penetrative definition excludes most female perpetrators due to forced envelopment vs penetration.
but if she put her finger in his butt, that would count as 'rape'?

what was your favorite part of auditioning?
similar to what trump does actually. he finds trolls and brainwashes them
ignorant americans just accuse the victims of being the ppl killing them).
thus many - if not most - male victims are excluded entirely from being statistically represented as rape vics.
unless a gay male predator was the one to have legitimately have raped those male vics.
please say a prayer for elizabeth "betty" wood today. she passed away on this day back in 1999. so many have been helped in her honor.

no i truly believe that they hate us because we have killed so many civilians on muslim soil.
we should never have gone to iraq. bush opened up pandora's box. bin ladin hated us because we occupied

trump finally reveals secret plan for fighting isis. he'll get “extremely tough over there". he’s probably gonna send some mean tweets!
he will probably have his stupid son deliver them skittles.

i gotta drive into the city now, dare i even ask for gas money?

you don't care about jen aniston, you're projecting your own hurt cus you know what it's like to have a man pass you up for the next chick.
can i pretend to have a chance w brad in peace?
what trump doesnt get when he says profile all us muslims is that includes 2 million african amers-my
its all about "trump" he could give a shit about anyone. his black, hispanic, muslim etc., is a collectors item
. calls clinton "chief emissary for globalism": "i'm not running to be president of the world."
ooooo big words for an idiot!!
publics have public accountability that 4profits lack. far from perfect, but prevents predation
i don't disagree but this argument has little to do with quality benefits of 90/10.

publics have public accountability that 4profits lack. far from perfect, but prevents predation
and after the ccsf fiasco bob you can't lecture about comm college accountability.
unfortunately, no. it's more complicated. otherwise i'd be asking everyone to donate $$ to fix it.
can i ask a stupid question? what are the big operational costs? work mostly w/public records &amp; foia reqs, no?
just makin' stuff up now over at cnn now:
just like hillary and obama! they lie

sweden- 70% of rape is committed by foreigners.

given how long he was a spokesman seems like he must have had a piece, but i dunno how these things work

yeah, half decent hoodies cost little and sell for a lot.
for this season... i get that. i might put george ahead. but he'd go top 5 to me
to put it better, i think you can build a title team w/ harden is clear cut better than those guys
oops i was gonna do work but then i started researching finnish.
not something you really want to start doing, it’s really hard to…finnish.
i don't understand your forecast model showing hrc down to a 56% chance when every poll since mon has favored her
literally 0 polls justify you tightening the race and widening trumps adv in fla..none
giggles u may have beat us in the regular season but ur first superbowl was a l we whooped that ass 27-10😎

not that south amboy is exactly "tree lined", but point well taken
also. nj is a wealth of under-appreciated beauty but there's nothing like staring at the cloud of smog that is manhattan at sunset.
virginia has more confederate monuments than any other state. what should it do with them?
liberia is there for a reason. feel free to move to poc-paradise any time.
harden's a top 5 player in this league. y'all watch too much vines and youtube videos and not enough games.
for this year only i have him top-10 for sure but would rather have kawhi, lebron, kd, steph, russ and cp3.
a big thank you to my thousand ! ☺️ celebrating with a !
i swear you have the most hair! and you're stunning in all ways of course! 😍😘
i don't think you can absorb it through your pores easily. i'm sure apple wouldn't use bpa, but they might use bps.
but bisphenol s (bps) is probably also an endocrine disrupter &amp; both of them stay in the environment forever, so they're both bad pr now.
trump bashes military for botched syria bombing, frets that russia is ‘absolutely furious at us’ he's bows to putin

she's irrelevant now and will stay that way. she's getting out polled by gary johnson ffs

its too bad no one in the press is covering her campaign.
haaa &lt;&lt;; i thought they had some limits where that was concerned. naegi was 'bonafide cinnamon roll' even in this fandom-
i thought that was fujisaki.
but bisphenol s (bps) is probably also an endocrine disrupter &amp; both of them stay in the environment forever, so they're both bad pr now.
interestingly, a major source of bpa &amp; bps contamination in the environment is apparently from thermal receipt paper that gets littered.
perhaps if she weren't shitfaced she could get up and wash those nasty damn clothes she's wearing.

how about alleged billionaire, small handed person and nazi
someone please give me motivation.. i have so many video ideas i just can't seem to find time to edit because i'm having fun playing..

seems like a nondeterministic behavior minefield
also, notice this stark philosophical difference: erlang: kill/log/restart on any error. go: ignore any error.
even with the videos… people still refuse to see. smh
ppl more worried abt skittles metaphor insulting group of ppl while our own citizens live in fear &amp; die in the street smh
as soon as we'd come home and say "nelly!" bb would run up the stairs and bark so loudly like "nelly! come on. they're here! walk time"
if you have dogs, you know how important routine is to them. they get very fixed on set specific steps and times/etc. to their daily routine
1)cp3 2)nash 3curry 4)j-kidd 5)agent zero if curry keeps it up, he is obviously.
i love your 1-4 and 100% agree, and arenas was awesome but i wouldn't have him 5. i'd rather have chauncey.
i found my high school resume &amp; about a third of it is just blatant lies but also i put my social security number on there for some reason?
whoever let me send this to other humans as an assessment of my value should be fired
peacefully so far. look at what just happened in mn. not worth the risk of bringing muslims in.
do you know how many muslims come here and become citizens peacefully. stop painting with broad brush.
a little happy thing commissioned by the awesome &lt;3
looks like a bunch of lothcat eevolutions awesome.
haha, i was referring to terminal 5.
oh haha! yeah for sure; that long uphill march from 11th to broadway after a show is the worst

that says access point 2.5 for horizon 7
2.7.2 is supported by horizon 7.0.2. that page needs to be updated
so today at work someone was like, "omg brad is getting divorced," and i thought she said barack and i got really upset. obviously not.
and this is the extent to which i give a flying fuck.
if you have dogs, you know how important routine is to them. they get very fixed on set specific steps and times/etc. to their daily routine
so that was part of bb's routine, waiting for nelly, running up and down the stairs, barking for her, etc.
the show new girl is all i ever want in my entire life. friends that are so close they are family and to be schmitt

looming towers, impervious cover, trees removed, too much intensity, park is on a slope, wheres the parking, zomg the traffic. .
park is on a slope! i should have taken a pick of prospect today while walking the dog.
why are charts &amp; awards still a thing? why are y'all still living vicariously through the achievements of artists as if they were your own?
to me, it's funny to see people say. "well my fave did this!" well, great. but what did you do today, bitch? i'm confused.
where are your seats?
you here as well?
because people can pop into cars during rush hour and not care about congestion because they are working, not driving?
it's possible. my point is mostly that "96% unused" includes 3am when there isn't much demand etc.

omg yeah i mean dont get me wrong i dont bash on the religion itself, but some of the followers are absolutely nuts
dray's a much better fit for harden imo. especially factoring in the mental side of the game.

it was just a joke bc of all the heated debating

it was cute in 2013 to keep kworb bookmarked but no thanks sis. charts are the barometer by which the lives of losers are dependent. lol
it's not whether or not your kids throw tantrums. it's how you react - that's the variable. your job is to be the calm to their storm.

"he looks like a big bad dude" i can't with this man. shot and killed and he has his hands up in the air the whole time. disgusting
police commentary: "i think he's on something." he's cooperating &amp; that's no reason to shoot someone. it's so disgusting
so that was part of bb's routine, waiting for nelly, running up and down the stairs, barking for her, etc.
and the last few days, she sort of been...confused. like, nelly's not here. but she's still waiting for her. and we're not calling for nelly
i'm almost at the point where i can't win anymore
now let me tell you about the hidden technique….kokushi musou.......
i would. she'll probably die before the election anyways. she's practically on her death bed now
fatso trump with high cholesterol &amp; high blood pressure will probably die b4 anyone.
everything happens for a reason. that reason causes change. sometimes it hurts. sometimes it is hard. but in the end it's all for the best
well then there's a lotta change in my life right now. :-/

i had a feeling you were a top fan when i saw you.
i told him sorry smh i didn't even mean to do it on purpose that's why i apologized. don't call me a savage.

and the last few days, she sort of been...confused. like, nelly's not here. but she's still waiting for her. and we're not calling for nelly
so like today, she just kind of sat on the middle of the stairs, not quite believing me when i was like "yeah we're going out, just us."

parker's started coming into his own after the first 4 titles though.
you said he doesn't believe in climate change. he does. you were wrong. that's the point.
"probably so" does not me he believes in it. that's so weak, he can't even say yes.
drunk enough to complete my hw
wait what is this i'm screaming
arenas was so selfish but he filled it up.
right, and he also was an asshat lol. all things i don't want in a pg.
(you know who to turn to ;333)
omfg yes i woudnt ask any else 😻💘✨
would definitely welcome the help. i've been started writing about teams, players etc. all over the place actually

you mean he didn't know or pay attention? can't be easy being a muslim in the usa nowadays.
so like today, she just kind of sat on the middle of the stairs, not quite believing me when i was like "yeah we're going out, just us."
and then there was sunday when she just sat in nelly's spot by her fan, sniffing the floor over and over again. it's confusing for her.

that's awesome. my life hasn't been the same since going from a standing desk to a cube...
whahhh hey how can i play? amazing!
this reddit comment has a good to;dr on getting going
peacefully so far. look at what just happened in mn. not worth the risk of bringing muslims in.
no mention of the middle age white men that shoot up stuff. ban them can't risk it. see how silly
ask us anything, if it gets enough points we'll answer it in our next video

anyway, tl/dr, death sucks, i want my dog back, please make all pets immortal, thank you.

remember the alamo!?
you mean when we took over mexican land by changing the borders??
apparently we live in an age now where it's not acceptable to ask to be paid for your work. "exposure" is the form of payment.
too many people willing to "sell" for exposure and free always undercuts any price. it's more of a supply problem...

if you report a suspicious person to the fbi, and the fbi doesn't make an arrest, there is a risk that the person will become president.
don't understand why they so surprised the fbi didn't see it coming. hillary has basically spat on them &amp; got away with it.

1+1=2 last time i checked. again, i was careful to use the word "reported" multiple times
it's a single primary source.. journalism isn't your string suit is it ?
f kettle chips
pack your bags
this image says it all. let's end the politically correct agenda that doesn't put america first.
you could just take one after the other, stupid.
people don't even know what a vegetarian is
wow do people live under a rock? lol cause that's crazy it's 2016. i would think people atleast get what a vegetarian is.
and i've been publicly pessimistic about it since it launched, probably a bit rudely, but the economics of it seem weird to me.
in retrospect, here's what drove me the most crazy about google's moonshots &amp; their past failures with partnerships. gmail &amp; docs, yes.

we hope you can too!
i don't know. i'm crushed! rt : bmw films making a comeback &gt; news.
just waiting on his text like "wut we doin' this weekend"
the problem is people tend to blindly believe what the media says without doing any research of their own the media tends to make the small
stories into big things and try to hide the bigger stories that is going on
if anything i might do amber before going back to brown
example pic?
rumor has it that i said diamonds was scratched from the jugette because lou pena was in her stall. if true, all i can say is lol.

in retrospect, here's what drove me the most crazy about google's moonshots &amp; their past failures with partnerships. gmail &amp; docs, yes.
google has a very long and successful partnership with the us military with all the secret geospatial stuff they do, and enterprise mapping.
worth a listen?
yes. it's like a train wreck in reverse. you get to watch him improve as he talks more about his past ideas.

this idea that refugees bring rape &amp; crime with them is so nakedly racist and evil.

the media are now anti-math 😂😂 i distinctly recall my 2nd grade teacher using m&amp;m's to help us learn math.
i don't think it's a matter of being anti-math. it's a matter of being logical. a skittle isn't the same value as a human life.
that sounds kinda sad. hope all is ok
why sad? very relaxing. get to be alone
just for record, this is gibberish. and he said it in furniture manufacturing center.

the android ecosystem around the google play store is incredibly strong. but they also spent a lot of money on an airline passenger system…
…aka airline reservation system (ars), called a "res system" in the biz, and didn't get any major carriers to buy in, so they shut it down.
i'm not gonna bother then because i know for a fact that i probably won't either 🤔😷

if you want to get really meta re the bushes, per kitty kelly's bio jeb is hw's favorite. not surprising he'd reject the guy who dissed him.
if it was just personal stuff, though, i doubt he'd have shared it with people, even a small group---feels like it'd be private.
it's just...i love republicans telling me how bad it is to fly effing money to iran after colonel north did it.

what if black cops were killing white men? where is your outrage?

what are your thoughts on jerry rice defending kaepernick?
rethought his position. certainly kaep's decision 2 kneel instead of sitting after talking 2 a military member may have helped
i think it is stupid if the patriots try and rush garrapolo back by telling him what tom brady has and hasn't played with.
well, it depends. what's garoppolo's true concern? that he won't be effective with his arm in pain? that it'll aggravate?
he brought the boom! 💥 (via trethatruth__/instagram)

ultimately i wonder what is the true in rice's heart, a lot of pressure was put on him to change his position and fall in line
definitely bro i think this is very similar to the 2010 class with dion waitets cj fair and fab melo let's hope!
white, thompson, lydon, roberson, battle; lot of length and athleticism
trouble finding a class to mystery skype with. help!! in us, 3rd grade, want to guess closest major city.

what are your thoughts on jerry rice defending kaepernick?
with his community.
smart contracts, in particular, require a very special kind of developer.
terminal chokepoint(and also "picks &amp; shovels" oppty) of smart contracts is hardened data sources; nobody has a clue how to solve it.
advantages: reasonable access to fidi, minimal new construction in sf, feeds all current bart lines, no sea level issues
main issue is 50% loss of highway capacity. political non-starter (for now). making bus lane in both directions more possible.
if you know what pt said after the prosecutors presented the case against lula and the other 8, you know what this guy spoke

my lifelong spurs fan of a grandad died early this morning. so close to him but hopefully he's in a better place now. rip

the info in the tweet above is why trump is beating clinton. the 1% is riding roughshod over the 99%. b4 its too late.
it was too late when hillary rigged the primaries with help of msm. no hope for clinton being replaced, sadly.
the patriots are despicable.

a vote for stein or johnson is a vote for trump &amp; there is something really wrong with electing trump.trumps pro fracking.

oh i was in shock when i finally read "mere christianity". though in a good way as i was beginning my exit from evangelicalism.
his writings nurtured my increasingly progressive evangelicalism. re-reading the bible and regular prayer showed me the exit.

i get close (just a little) and i wasn't screaming, i said to him "michael, i love your smile" and he smiled to me.
that's good. just be careful in situations if such you can get hurt. those girls are ruthless.

i just turned a horrible negative mood into a positive productive thing and that's such a good feeling.
although i did write my most angry and personal hardcore song ever so that was kinda cool too
took me engaging in modern day imperialism to open my eyes and look at what it's like where i live
land of the free and home of the brave. i'm so lucky that i get to see myself in that. and finally can see that others don't.
we are in love!

agreed! but i feel at some point the figures will unionize. the pay they get is a joke.
the more money ufc draws, the more confident they'll be in doing what they want. this puts more pressure on fighters
more interesting to me is why hrc or any dem/lib isnt crushing it rn. because the opportunity is there
people think she's just as dishonest and a national security risk.

sean hannity in trouble at fox after participating in trump ad:
there are three things i love about that gif.. 1 is the prancing, 2nd is the suit and 3rd is... what was the third again?
more interesting to me is why hrc or any dem/lib isnt crushing it rn. because the opportunity is there
not sure why the fact that trump could appoint up to 3 ultra conservative supreme court justices isn't a bigger deal
right!? hopefully someone does or just bring jelaminah back to teach her a lesson
i literally tweeted her and was like "let her know!"
pretty sure i'm gonna start crying pretty soon and i don't have time for that rn bc i have more important things to do smh
i just cried enough for the both of us. u good fam.
say u don't like her but try not to talk shit about the wonderful thing she did in becoming a parent to children who needed it
that's actually a great compromise. i will tweet this exact thing.
ny's response to terror was cool and almost indifferent—which means rational and inspiring.

he then failed to make a break to cover second for possible force on lineout to 3b. not his finest moment. still young, still learning 2b.
i'm sure pedroia and or bogey may say something
my prediction: trump will make awful, indefensible and false statements during the debate. and then he will double down on them afterwards.
you called it!
thank you nevada!
let's make america great again!
truth. they don't fear black, muslim, latino, immigrant or lgbtq americans. they want them segregated, oppressed &amp;…
they really dont fear these souls. white supremacy is based on power *over* these souls. it's the mother of racism.

agreed! but i feel at some point the figures will unionize. the pay they get is a joke.
i don't think they'll unionize. ufc is their only platform, they can't make more money elsewhere. they'd be stuck tbh.

i mean let's be honest.. if i'm asking u to do something a diff way than how you're doing it.. it's cause of how i got it in the past right?
yes, it's a given. but we're all adults, u should be able to say how u like something done w/o attitude. we all have preferences.

i'll say it...bum acted like a thug....a fake one albeit.
i have heard many, many veterans say this. and their spouses/partners, too.
all we think about "over there" is what we'll do when we get home. dream too big. you get back. you flop. you're in deep ca-ca!
tennistv is a good enough product that they could have raised the price for an annual subscription next year, and i would have bought it.

trump has tweeted 5,847 times more than us, the tv show with a damn @ in our title. do you really want a president who posts that much?
what's happens when 5,848 refers to tennant and the tardis?
wait, weren't the bush's deemed nazi's by media/left before supporting hillary? 🤔
not by me.i think i used the term "anti-intellectual buffoons" but they are on the right side now
where do track it? also, do we track tweet response times?
go/ats. think the tab was called "all interviewers" or something like that
really? who do you like so much?
weekes, hull, chelios, cohn, panger, buccigross.
a different take: since corey thinks nicole should take james, he probably argued the hardest...
exactly he was in her head
its as if they're terrified of criticism, that they don't realize that criticism is a part of the game and they need to grow up…

not to mention reagan. so i'm sympathetic to the idea that the federal government has overstepped some "commerce" boundaries.

he is the globalist establishment...
isn't the clinton foundation funded by "other peoples money" oh like saudi arabia, kuwait, qatar, among a few, incl…
the difference is this would be like the clinton foundation paying the clinton|kaine campaign expenses- which would be fraud.

here's an idea: lose the damn studio audience at the debates. no one cares about hearing their circus noises. treat it like kennedy/nixon.

they don't because they've dealt with him in the past. he's well known in the financial community.

the live audience feeds the narcissism of the network moderators as much as for the candidates tbh hence the pushback
live audience reminds us how to react to sound bites because we're dead inside and don't understand emotions.
africa has china in the south, the us with canada overlaid in the west, mexico in the north, and two copies of india in the east.
europe has texas in the west, then california + nevada, then greenland over the scandinavian countries.

yes but i can't rly remember the last time i heard an alarm and was like,, "oh no a car is being broken into!"

at the very least, the guy is writing above a third grade level, which is unfortunately rare in mainstream hip hop.

and to get back to my original point about the variety obit: i do not care if river wild was "derivative," it's a fucking fantastic movie.
again, this is because evidence of wrongdoing around her has a tendency to vanish or get ignored.
i'm sure you'd agree that also, as well, she gets accused of lots of insane bullshit that she didn't, in fact, do.
la is good to me too honestly. lmk if you ever get to the twin cities tho
im a biased mid westerner. cheers m8
oddly, it is clinton who has stated that she would destroy my livelihood (to please a big donor) while trump would save it.
if you think that trump would do anything for anybody but himself, you are living in dreamland. trump is a con man &amp; a criminal.

just bc we share the title of poc doesn't mean we share the same experiences of the black community and to think so is incredibly naive
we will never experience the same oppression, adversity and fear that our black friends, colleagues and family members do

four loko is not the answer. four loko is the question, yes is the answer.
no the question is "will i be full of regrets soon" and the answer is "where are my shoes"

happy birthday ! i have a good one 💕🎉
thanks liselle!! 😊 where you at with the jell-o shots! 😂😂
tried it. don't like it.
web views are trash because web is not treated as a first class citizen on ios. it doesn't have to be that way.
it's very cool, but feels like it should be at 3ld instead of broadway. i think a lot of audience didn't know what to make of it.
i kind of wish i had sat closer. i could see fine but there's a weird disconnect between the intimacy of the sound &amp; the distance
nah, penance stare. ghost rider winner
true. though once she uses her quake power. he's neutralized!!!
i admit im partial to french connection style car chases and mamet dialogue.

you're assuming that you're the only one hearing the alarm tho which chances are you're not
no im assuming that even if other ppl heard my car alarm, they wouldn't really care bc a) car alarms are notoriously

these rankings are garbage. rhode island?.. i'm sorry what? cuse is hated on every year and they'll continue to prove people wrong
people love to hate cuse and they get so salty when they see us do well
also, for the record, when i say "slow start" i don't mean "7 hours". the bug hunting isn't great, but it's not bad
bug hunting was pretty dull as i recall. did i hear they streamlined the bug hinting in hd? fewer to find?

please do a cine-files on la confidential! a perfect film imho.
uh huh, sure, some polls 6 months ago had bernie beating trump. riiiggghht
not 6 months ago, and when they were running against each other dipshit.
really?? why would you propose then??
44 mins later &amp; still something inside of me just churns at that guy proposing right then! ? who? me or him?😬
also if it wasn't for the giants epically collapsing, they would be done. mets have been good but also very fortunate.
luck is always a part of everything.
trump campaign “responds” to story by attacking him.
shocker. also deflecting by blaming hillary of something worse, without any specifics.
your on twitter . do a survey n ask? might b time to bring back the good old classics .. 🏀 tournaments and charity games . dm
currently i'm trying to build a network and inform everyone on what's happening around town.
talk about traitor
i'm actually part canadian sooooooooo

conforto, johnson, and nimmo provide more than bruce does as of today. that shouldn't even be debate.
right now yes. would you have cut grandy too? just wondering.
this is very serious. he's a major exec at an important, growing business.
i had this talk with my gf too. she is looking for a cancer research postdoc in 2 yrs and if trump wins it make a diff
only if u're interested in a loser trying to make a career as a trump uber-sycophant
sounds absolutely fascinating!otherwise why would u hate him so intensely
cris cyborg says she currently weighs 165 pounds. needs to weigh 141 on friday. live now:

when did found footage stop looking like random people holding a vhs camcorder and start looking like professional dps w/ a red?
after that it never really feels like real found footage. blair witch was one of the only ones to give characters cameras
lacks auth access to non-shared albums, when locked?
nope. same user.
no im assuming that even if other ppl heard my car alarm, they wouldn't really care bc a) car alarms are notoriously
faulty and b) they do not know if it's their car or my car until they go see which car it is
atlanta has beaten the mets 9 times this year.
yay! braves. rockies aren't helping.
the story posted 12 hours ago. trump camp clearly underestimated how bad this would be and is scrambling

you're supposed to stay focused on your breath and your image in the mirror...
but as this woman struggled and pushed through the poses i thought of my mother and how she would have loved the challenge.
you've been asked to write a script using this for inspiration. what's the first line? c/o…
m.freeman:joe and ken were made for one another, bar would understand, she'd move on.
that's one badass track.
maybe we'll write one called buzzsaw lightyear just to come full circle. you sing backup?
so about what i said on saturday... i meant marlins/cardinals wildcard. ugh
that would rate a zero on the nielsen ratings. mlb would love that. they want giants/mets.
well, maybe team usa can find a gritty bar
a gritty golf course
interesting observation...but very limited and shortsighted imo
read what's running at this hour. they r on the same page as to my post today
kate feels sorry for ben really

curtis hanson, director of "l.a. confidential," dies at 71
tragic loss for cinema.
interesting how brad takes on the identities of his lovers. looking forward to his marion cotillard period.
people who take on their lovers identities / copy their interests are hollow and sad
they dont make money.
i was forced to go see sully. what a joke that was. felt like a history channel episode
yes, i heard that too. will kick himself later during play back.
i saw trump's tax returns. you should, too. via
i had this talk with my gf too. she is looking for a cancer research postdoc in 2 yrs and if trump wins it make a diff
from the outside (canadian) it feels like "of course this won't happen" but the thought is chilling
so about what i said on saturday... i meant marlins/cardinals wildcard. ugh
too bad baseball is hard to fix haha
poking around in some old folders, i've been called out on 4chan so many times
i'm very proud of my shitposting legacy, at my incredible lack of self control

here it is again. in june, right before the end of the primary:
haters: here is what i said on about re: vote for her: "i respect the 92-year-old president very much, and his decision."
kellyanne that is precisely what you said, respecfully.
i think the same thing happened to me on my way back from twitchcon last year. i don't understand why they can't make exceptions...
safety and protocol - i get it. i did try really hard to get them to let me in
yup that's the one!

trump campaign “responds” to story by attacking him.
trump is so full of it! his lies are so natural.
you should do an astrology thread! — what kind of thread!
like specifics i mean ...
i was lagging
lmao dude my bro a bad vibe bringing us down
i'm trying. it better spark intense heat, debate &amp;change. not saying it won't happen again but this darkness got to give
it will be brushed under the rug on mainstream media by some stupid trump comment by monday.
it's not enough for trump to lose the election. his brand needs to tank, his empire must crumble, and he needs to starve in a gutter
it will be a landslide win
im ignorant on jasta-u know 2 much, sir!
jasta is bill so families of 911 survivors can sue saudi arabia. obama on the wrong side of this one

long wolf terrorist attack == terrorist attack terror-cell terrorist attack == terrorist attack what else does anyone need?
need a little patience.
i have no doubt i would much prefer the news in another state. glad to hear it's just la that's broken &amp; not all of ca.
entertainment is the major industry in l.a. some don't realize that when they complain about celebrity news in local news.
your mom literally bought me one of these
are my feelings rooted in jealousy? perhaps it is because i wouldn't feel confident with my fat neck
you clearly did what? you jumped into my mentions all asshurt because little girl jill is going to lose 😂😂
i clearly hit a nerve. we knew jill was going to lose. you're the one who's clearly butthurt because hillary is going to lose.
rt to win: morphe brush set &amp; brush cleaner from ! must be following both of us ✨
oh crap i am already i need it 👀👀▶️🐼
why don't you start watching hemlock grove on netflix so you can self-actualize as a trash tv-enjoying freak like me
because i cant reward myself like that
by the way...to be clear. death threats and neo nazi crap do not scare me. these ppl are wimps. i will keep doing my job without hesitation.
thank you for telling the truth 👏🏻👏🏻

also being in eyesight doesn't necessarily mean you're looking at it. the alarm is there to draw your attention
but bc alarms go off so frequently for small reasons, the amount of serious attention that they receive is very slim

it won't be you!! wow! what a resume!😂
still not sure why texas punted e 1:45 left in the game down 7
because they figured their chances were better holding us without a 1st down than to get the first and continue the drive.
. i hate to tell you, but we have no choice! believe me, melania will be deported on day one!

agree, never watch
oh okay out friendship has passed yet another test
lmfao i'm glad. it would be so sad to see it end 😔.
but bc alarms go off so frequently for small reasons, the amount of serious attention that they receive is very slim
i'd venture to guess that most ppl hear an alarm and think "annoyance" rather than "emergency"
duh ... people be like i hate high school im like blood what? i had hella fun especially cause i was all the older kids 😂
exactly, high school was dumbass fun, you just had to be around the right people

i get this weird feeling that when airbnb's co-founders say refugees , they mean anywhere the hell away from them.
and a video or direct quote of clinton saying she wants to abolish the 2nd amendment.
conspiracy theories. he's insane.
but hillary accepts millions from countries who suppress woman, kill homosexulas etc.
a lot more than trump.
can we just have another dnc? there's no rule against that, right?
scariest part is the bounce back. if trump times one of those right before nov 8, he could win.

it won't do any good if hrc wins and democrats don't get majority in senate in terms of getting a scotus nominee confirmed.

and you can save half that money by replacing agents to computers and digital entry to trains. fyi..
so it turns out i'm irrationally afraid of butterflies. seriously. i ducked and covered each time one flew near.…
yes they're quite terrifying as they delicately tear into the soft flesh of enemy fruit
sometimes you have to stop hoping for better cards and just deal with the cards you were dealt.

he was a crowd charmer!
lol you're right i guess that's true!
about what sorry i got a lot of mentions right now lol
i know it's annoying to keep hearing this but the show is so damn good. s4 and 5 are exceptional.
it's also the best argument for serialized television drama. one cohesive story with a well-defined beginning, middle, and end.
i remember when saying they wanted you from ages ago. take gs by storm, my friend ✊🏽
what? i have no recollection of such statements.
more than 50% of americans own stock in corporations. check these facts for yourself
that's irrelevant to your direct financial gain from the legalization of marijuana... go bore someone else with your greed!🙄
i thought we agreed we don't like trump?? are we arguing? i can't tell.
lol no we're not!
fall festival was a success! want to know more about the , join us for our citizen's academy…

inspired by my convo with on today
hard 2 root 4 ur team plays a bad…
you know nothing of the clinton foundation. and virtually all campaign contributions are legal now.
legal doesn't mean they're not suspect. citizens united is law of land, aren't u supposed to be against it? ugh.
all the while, i'm trying to find where i can get an apple leather case by the weekend without driving 1.5 hours.

we've already established the basement loser is you, and reuters poolls everybody. nice try.
why do you get a detention for one tardy. odowd sucks
duude tomorrow after school? same. odowd is such a joke lmao
you have proof he lynched anyone? and you can stick a sock in your stupid smears.
byrd was born into the kkk. he was an exhalted cyclops, of course he lynched blacks. wake up!
i told you ! it's super obvious he did it
3. if he was found guilty shame would of been brought to the family name &amp; he would have went to jail for sure
i believe that hillary clinton does in fact care about people and communities. her life hasn't been easy. she is flawed for sure. so are we.
speak for yourself.
hey y'all, lives in nyc now and all is right with the world. 🙌🏼💃🏻🍷😄👏🏼❤️👊🏼🎉🏡🍜🏙👯

you know who i'd really like to see in the 2017 bullpen, besides aj minter? james robert johnson
yes. him, simmons, minter, mocab...that could be a great bullpen. better than o'ventbrel.
that fierce texas defense had only given up 50 points up to that point
you asked why not if i thought it was a good idea. they had only yielded 14 in the 2nd.
. teases role: "i'm naked in it quite a bit!"
he was wearing underwear- we saw the raw in edit version🙄
there are so many provably false statements here
lie after lie after lie. if they're not white supremacists and deplorable people, just how stupid are trump's supporters?!
if you want peppermint you'll have to move to canada.

but really, does tauba's work get talked about in type circles?
wouldn't call myself a circle but my roommate did mention her work like 2 days ago and i complained abt her website lol
huh? that was 20 years ago. you do know that 2015 was officially the hottest year on record since 1880?…
back in may, scientists were already predicting a 99% chance that this year will be hotter than 2015.
we remember...

mets had no options at that point. with expanded rosters, they very much do.
so if the rosters were expanded and grandy was struggling as he was - you’d say bench him?

why did the bad guys install a self destruct sequence in everyone of their plots?!?

i've been trying to tell myself this a lot lately, but my pride gets in the way 😩
just take it one day at a time
i guessed this before. i want it noted.
ugh, i did as well. i don't know if i'm pleased with myself or just disappointed with the show.
do people notice hillary is copying my airplane rallies - she puts the plane behind her like i have been doing from the beginning.

trump foundation exposed as scam &amp; trump says: no—it’s clinton foundation that’s bad. this is mo of his campaign: accuse rival of yr faults.
he's a little baby and argues like a child. he's a sociopath and creepy

he can't 1.27b in a faux tax dodge?(501(c)3.he pays himself tax free?take ur pick of game enderswish some1reported

very detailed and well written review on horizon 3 from
one of the best reviews i have read . they do a good job
this is a season of taking solace in minor victories... helping knock the mets out of the playoffs would be a nice one.
i'd rather have the mets than the giants or cardinals
like you? not much. like living here? we are citizens and don't need your permission to be here.
i didn't say you did. i said jews like living here, they don't try to slaughter us with bombs, ever
or can yall help me out in restoring them
i'm not taking orders for restorations at the moment. sorry about that
i stand by this
never understood why fans wanted a split...
after 2 years of all republicans, we would end up having a divided government again. just like the bush admin.

in what language does "not terrible" translate to "easy"? matchup is very winnable. far from a bye. very skill testing.
in magic hyperbole! the point is it goes both ways, i think burn is favored in the match up.
i'm not a trump supporter but if you can't read that as a plain denial then you're losing objectivity, imho.
'no intent, motive' a very convoluted denial at best. feels evasive. not the same as 'no, that did not happen'

hometown bar scene is weird. i had a drink that was made with peach schnapps and red bull and something else. it was okay?

. crouton is just a chroot environment, &amp; there's nothing exotic about building any kind of chroot you want inside an android phone.
thanks to you
when i'm back home i'll make some and make it all😍✊🏼
. these folks i'm highlighting may be extreme examples but often "why aren't you covering x?!?!" is a bad argument
. because the vast majority of time the person complaining about lack of coverage of x only knows about it through coverage
happy 21st to my best bud, thanks for all the laughs and good timez 💞 ;) hope it was the greatest🎉

lmfaoooooo blocked me after i pointed out her paper doesn't cover trump's foundation. i must have struck a nerve.

oh, what was the last episode you watched? it's currently ongoing with the last ep (24) i think to air this week
i just finished ep 19, but i don't think i would've been able to make it this far without the power of 2-4x speed viewing, haha
one way in which 9/11 impacted me...
craig, the useful idiot to islam speaks again.
i sure hope so i love my lil king to death and i'm so proud of him
you got be proud of yourself as well. *hugs to you both*
y'all!!! i passed my comps at the phd level!!! !!!!
congratulations, it's a big step :)
4)but even the best sets had moments that left me cold, where the hand clapping sing alongs felt false.
5) &amp; those moments made me realize what i treasure about music is its ability to pierce my frozen wasp-y heart and make me feel something.
great to hear. what sort of cocktails do you usually go for? more on the fruity side?
well i'm a bartender so i like all kinds of drinks! whisky and gin drinks are my favorite!
heavy breathing in spanish
(disapproving glare in spanish)
5) &amp; those moments made me realize what i treasure about music is its ability to pierce my frozen wasp-y heart and make me feel something.
6)but they also let me imagine an alternate reality, or possible future, when i felt nothing, even as everyone around me danced.
freshmen ➡️ senior year 💞 definition of a day 1 😽😽
talk about our glo up tho
i just finished ep 19, but i don't think i would've been able to make it this far without the power of 2-4x speed viewing, haha
the worst p.a. works show before this imo was glasslip, but even that was a contained trainwreck in that it knew its genre
tomorrow's the first time in 9 years i won't get the new iphone on launch day been something of a tradition it's petty, but a bit bummed 😕
scratch that...first time in 10 years. 2007-2016
. where the answer to falling victim to the evil folly of others? the gain is singular, not unto the foolish, or the rich.
s'cusi. pearls to swine
6)but they also let me imagine an alternate reality, or possible future, when i felt nothing, even as everyone around me danced.
7)and that was terrifying. i do not suffer from clinical depression, and hope i’m not minimizing it by wondering if that’s what it’s like.
il mio lago. thi is limone at sunset, a beautiful place on lake garda ( benacus ) italy
absolutely beautiful alberto. have a wonderful friday
just a heads up next under 21 open mic coming up on september 30th in sf details to come ✨✨
will you be there? :)
except it is absolutely false:
1/2) not to act troll-like, but politico redefines meaning "to include birth certificate request"
damn :/ i did wanna try to go on another day, but didn't have money to buy them when they first went on sale.
it's fine it will still be fun
so you rave now lol 😉
bruh lol the life chose me
so sweet that jimmy fallon is having fun with a racist piece of human garbage.
does this look like a racist piece of human garbage? of course not.
she is going through shit and she hates herself so gay
i dont give a shit, if you ask for my opinion, im not going to sugarcoat it
come here on a thursday! r&amp;b and hip hop night
i was there last thursday ! + their fish bowls😍
9 obama executive orders cost taxpayers $31 billion and if she is elected she will make him look like an amateur
barry's executive orders are written by his handlers. soros, etc. his time is spent campaigning for crooked hillary and money
7)and that was terrifying. i do not suffer from clinical depression, and hope i’m not minimizing it by wondering if that’s what it’s like.
8)because if it is even slightly close to what it’s like, then…fuuuuccckkk.
also checkout they may have some in sf if you're on at&amp;t.
eh already preordered on launch night. just not delivering till first week of october.
sorry i don't know the exact right path to take in this dungeon, i'll think about my inadequacy while i wait for the daily lockout to clear
gatekeeping in all things at all times
constantly getting all the feels every fucking time otl
i feel that, which is why im watching bjb again tmr
i'm not even about the races 😂 but leo always wants to race :(
well you building your car like one so that's the impression you giving lol
8)because if it is even slightly close to what it’s like, then…fuuuuccckkk.
9)i was born without faith. i don’t believe in god, or an afterlife. the only transcendence i’ve ever felt is at shows, or in headphones.
snowden lied and acted out of pique, house report charges
why didn't he leak russian secrets! wait🤔 putin would kill him.
1/2) not to act troll-like, but politico redefines meaning "to include birth certificate request"
2/2) per , '07 clinton chief strategist, memo issued 2 top surrogates 2 create innuendo
so my daughter wants to go thrifting for her birthday
u already kno the right thing to do.
9)i was born without faith. i don’t believe in god, or an afterlife. the only transcendence i’ve ever felt is at shows, or in headphones.
10)so, the possibility of that communion suddenly feeling empty horrifies me.
don't normally respond to these but this is so out of context &amp; unfair. what aired b4 &amp; after are important.
i agree with ! what is wrong with ?! you have been losing viewers because of crap just like this! he's !
the worst p.a. works show before this imo was glasslip, but even that was a contained trainwreck in that it knew its genre
with kuromukuro, there's such a loose form of story telling that we've got the misadventures of a side character trying to
i got this, too. i thought i was special.
jaime i thought we were special snapchat friends
seen anyone smelling their own fart?
just me. it's just like they described it though. boring &amp; stuck up. can't even buy tabs anywhere
with kuromukuro, there's such a loose form of story telling that we've got the misadventures of a side character trying to
become a cosplay net celebrity inordinately outweighing its convoluted sci-fi alien threat plot
10)so, the possibility of that communion suddenly feeling empty horrifies me.
11)and i realized that’s why i have zero patience for bands that waste my time. and why i love the bands i do beyond reason.
is anything grosser than being cutesy with trump? he's an anti-semite and virulent racist, so let's ruffle his hair.
of course hes none of those things, look at that adorable face
lmao god i'm bad at numbers yeah i'll bet anything it was in mb
. ok i don't have to sit around guessing, i have the source code here. let me load android studio &amp; find out for you.
need to be in a better mood 😞
cheer up buttercup
11)and i realized that’s why i have zero patience for bands that waste my time. and why i love the bands i do beyond reason.
12)final note, for anyone on or near the west coast: go to pappy and harriet’s on 9/21 to see the mekons.
you really have to learn how to love yourself before you can love someone else
i feel like some people jump into relationships and then realize they can't love their partner bc they struggle with loving themselves
i'll get to it. don't worry. lol.
i'm about as worried about you finishing a book as you finishing a tv show... never gonna happen

12)final note, for anyone on or near the west coast: go to pappy and harriet’s on 9/21 to see the mekons.
13)i have seen a gajillion bands. none more reliably tread the line between absurdity and brilliance like the mekons.
i know but you actually didnt rate you just stated an opinion when you dontknow whats happening
i said she was not attractive to me because she was clearly begging for attention by claiming she was ugly
again it show your ignorance and that you don't know arabic 4:89 is about fighting ( ideologies ) of disbelievers
come and try it. lets see how muslim you are....
hmmm. you turned on notifications on my tweets??😍😍 heheh
i thought i just added you to my favorites...maybe thats what i did instead lol.
yaaa but i'm still a massive ky fan don't get me wrong
her new ones are better and kyshadow changed my life😍
become a cosplay net celebrity inordinately outweighing its convoluted sci-fi alien threat plot
the female protag has also gotten superbly annoying to me in how meek, pouty, and powerless she is-
13)i have seen a gajillion bands. none more reliably tread the line between absurdity and brilliance like the mekons.
14)see the mekons in the desert while you still can. you might just see god. 15)thus endeth this lesson.
i said she was not attractive to me because she was clearly begging for attention by claiming she was ugly
im ugly as a foot and i act like hot shit because of confidence
the female protag has also gotten superbly annoying to me in how meek, pouty, and powerless she is-
definitely pales in comparison to the stories of growth for female leads in other p.a. works productions////

i'm real life shook i'm about to ball out real quick
yassss fuck it up 😘
funny how pundits try to rationalize why trump won't just apologize 4 his birther remark. he can't do so live...cos he is an egotist.
he also can't do it or 50% of his base drops 2 minutes later.
i read this and instantly thought about you. lol

moral of the story
i felt very much like dave kujan having the rug pulled out from under him. good misdirection
in hindsight i guess i do have natural talent in being a manipulator of people that i don't realize myself.
i still wonder what the '84 cubs would have done against the tigers. that cubs tm was fun. should hv been in the ws.
steve garvey felt differently. and sutcliffe's "split fingered fastball" was a spitter. tigers won ws in april.
i don't know how you manage to work at might omg
then when i finally did sleep it was going on 6something. mind you i got iut of school at 1 got home by 2something

how was the rest of the show?
it was v good. the warfield was such a perfect venue. i hadn't given much of their new stuff a chance, but def gonna peep now
why we should fear mike pence for refusing to call david duke “deplorable”
mike pence is limbaugh with a smile on his face. he's very dangerous to women.
well then i guess that explains it,but what it doesn't explain is y hasn't he been arrests in 8yrs? fake
easy, his attorney general breaks the law as well.
who cares. look at apo, no one gives a crap about him anymore. he will just rot in prison. murderers need to be behind bars.
i agree but it was different with apo as the head of pkk terror group. they think slimeball demirtas is a freedom fighter.
especially since it seemed to start happening after i replaced the original hdd with a smaller ssd. the 250gb samsung is working great.
i even downloaded the latest firmware updater from the samsung site (the bootable iso, which i burned to a real dvd+r).

does it trip you out that no one ever found the zodiac killer? because it really freaks me out
and how someone profiled him to be a black man and the police potentially saw him and didn't suspect him bc he was white??
if you live in california go look at the moon!! it's not gold this time but it's still super duper pretty!!
keep in mind the only reason the moon changes its color is because of all the pollution 😂 if it's not white than you know why lol
jimmy fallon is cancelled for me. when you help make a dangerous individual likeable, you do politics, like it or not
fallon didn't help make trump likeable, trump is likeable all on his own

trump did everyone a favor. he forced obama to release his birth certificate &amp; end the rumors.
but trump still won't give up on this idea. is he afraid of alienating some hard-core racists in his coalition?
i dont draw any of my furries w glasses anymore i wonder what that means
(that theyre cuter w/o them lmao fdkgmfdkgh i dont rock glasses very well but...i look like hope w/o them so. suffers)
that picture of obama looking like a muslim was leaked by her campaign.
its a little murky, but i think that you are right on this one.
jimmy fallon fails us all due to self absorption yet again
wtf did you want jimmy fallon to do?
teach me your secrets
omg. it was just transcribing. not like actual original ideas. that would be insane.
so you're vegan but you still drink water??? that's a fish's house

trump is a naturally funny guy
fun fact: most people saying colin kaepernick is unpatriotic for criticizing america are wearing red ball caps that say america isn't great.

truly deplorable and heartbreaking. 😔
people are complaining about jimmy fallon like talk shows are real and not just for promoting shit at all. they're 99% staged guys.
they thought this was larry king live
so, i’m totally grokking the difference, and obv see the value in explicit (ie. let vs. var) - always in favor of being explicit
sorry, i get so used to teaching beginner devs, that i sometimes forget that your issue wasn’t due to a lack of understanding

a couple of setbacks this year but -
watching videos of beyonce's work ethic, especially as a virgo, is so motivating to snatch it together.

ah ok. so it could be a lot of kernel issues. that's a big problem with cyanogenmod on non-developer devices.
what's the best height and weight this year for a center?
go with the stretcher or glass cleaner
until minecraft came along. kids growing up *will* start building houses using interchangeable blocks.
. it's possible, but a radical change from how building is done today in industrialized countries
ah ok. so it could be a lot of kernel issues. that's a big problem with cyanogenmod on non-developer devices.
sometimes people overclock their kernels and their phones crash all the time because of that. or just bugs in the throttling.

setting up a hackintosh?
but jimmy fallon has a far broader reach, especially to plebs who don't read but do watch the telly and vote.
the media has gone soft on trump? what planet are you guys living on?
do you really believe that the us tightening immigration policy will cause other countries to stop trading with us? you seriously..
there are a ton of nations whose populations aren’t white who won’t want to deal with the us. especially if there is an option
. …it's really unfortunate because the 2013 moto g looks like it had a similar type of snapdragon chip as the earlier nexus 4.

he talks a lot, but people are still dying in the russian aggressions.
hm… the right set of circumstances can bring about untold options. look at the patriot act, the rescission to invade was …

successful in the global business world by being a raging racist? he has proven that he can put those issues aside
i don’t know if i would call 6 bankruptcies successful. you look at his failed businesses schemes the scary trump university
so this dress falls perfectly into place after that but do u kno how much of a pain it was i think not
this is so cute i can't 😭😭😭
why are people so mad at jimmy fallon? the problem isn't that trump is on tv, it's that he's a presidential candidate.
i cant wait till he stops being a candidate and becomes president already
i don’t know if i would call 6 bankruptcies successful. you look at his failed businesses schemes the scary trump university
if that’s what you call successful then this is a pointless discussion.
trump's entire campaign is based on hatred of women and minorities. xenophobic, bigoted, and racist. very disappointed in jimmy fallon.
ll you really believe all that stuff? i thought bernies were smarter than that
please explain to me the logistics of any potus creating a nazi regime in the united states.
i could flip this argument saying the second amendmentcould be scrapped by the same argument. but that’s a totally separate

i could flip this argument saying the second amendmentcould be scrapped by the same argument. but that’s a totally separate

jimmy fallon has always been a piece of shit to me, i'm not surprised.

so, you should write drunk, edit sober, right? asking for a friend.
according to hemingway it's "write drunk and find a sober editor". not that i'm volunteering.

today, i voted to put an end to the president’s plans to transfer known terrorists who want to do harm to americans
hey, brainiac, that's not what you voted for
all jimmy fallon had to do was ask about donald trumps rape case to donald himself but he just humored the child rapist for money &amp; ratings.
your fake rumor spreading tactics suck and are very outdated
talked w customer care &amp; retail all week &amp; even had cc hang up on me. a year after switching &amp; still no etf refunds. $700+ gone

proud to be watching my father lay out a bold vision to get americans working again. we stand with the worker, not big party donors!

subtle reference there
kind of, if we're just trying to relate demon duelist to original haou. and i have a feeling this dragon will appear in ep125.
my father spent his life building &amp; creating jobs. hillary spent her life selling out america &amp; telling lies. who do you want to lead?
did hillary discriminate against minorities in her youth?

very wide stance she takes, but with hips that wide it's understandable

to sell 200k in a week.. they gotta ship like 600k copies (unlikely) &amp; every 1500 streams = 1 sale ? ... its a crazy game

"when i’m under the weather, i can afford to take a few days off. millions of americans can’t." hillary in nc today:

price is a little high for what it is

proud to be watching my father lay out a bold vision to get americans working again. we stand with the worker, not big party donors!
why do white supremacists love you?
it's so funny seeing trumpets defend jimmy fallon, saying its just for comedy. if it was hillary last night, everyone would be attacking.
hillary already did the show it was boring as hell, we dont get triggered when people do their job
a honda pilot is 50k??? ummmm
right? car prices are weird these days

dems seek to rid virginia constitution of felon voting ban

trump is most abhorrent pres candidate in 50 yrs. but by '38, riefenstahl had made triumph of the will and there were concentration camps.
does this look like the face of an abhorrent presidential candidate?
fuck fallon.
did he “slow jam“ trump’s immigration plan?
bruce so sorry for your loss.
sorry bruce - you're in my prayers ....

i know eric is on the 'five' but steve doocy no doesn't sound familiar
i don't see him as much anymore. he is on the early morning fox&amp; friend
can you imagine jimmy fallon doing that to potus or hrc? fallon, subconsciously, showing, he doesn't respect trump. it was clown show.
it was the most beautiful moment on tv in the last 20 years
and they look fine until you add more than two ip addresses then big scrollbars make it so you can only see one.
ditto with advanced system properties
going back to bed so let me just say that jimmy fallon has always been garbage
why you hatin?
electing a president is not easy until now there is no question that djt should &amp; will bthe next potus has all qualifications

need to get my domain fixed but godaddy doesn't have 24 hour customer service. i find that odd for a web company.
thankfully part of the reason i need to contact them is to transfer my domains away from them. :)
because i've never seen it work. there's always someone in the hierarchy who will not like "no." it take just one to be at risk.
i should qualify; saying "no" when it really, really matters. unless you are irreplaceable, leader or can walk away.
2 new releases 2in1day morning load &amp; bedtime load / just dropped 10inches &amp; 2 volcanic cum shots go

the chinese subs of ep 122 are live; if i can turn off subtitles on this file i'll have a raw...
